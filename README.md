# A practical way to learn Selenium and practice programming simultaneously

Team [Qxf2](https://qxf2.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=Weather%20shopper) created a web application to help testers learn Selenium and practice a programming language simultaneously. You can visit http://weathershopper.pythonanywhere.com. Each page will have an 'i' icon that you can click and read the task you need to complete.

NOTE: The web application may seem really simple on the surface but we have randomized the data on each page just enough that you will find some parts challenging.

You can stop reading here if you don't want to read too many details

h) wait for form submission

## Practicing programming

By completing this challenge, here is what you will do on the programming side of things: 

a) if-else 

b) typecast scraped data 

c) loop through elements 

d) write code to identify the minimum 

e) substring search 

f) write good methods 

g) simple arithmetic operations (sum of) 

h) assert correctness 

i) work with 2-D arrays to construct a good locator
